The following project focuses on analysing BTC's trend, correlation to alt-coins (Pearson Coefficient), and price volatility (Garch Method). The last section of the notebook is another project I will perhaps work on in the future. 

NOTE: Some notes in the notebook are just references or jargon used for my own sake.
